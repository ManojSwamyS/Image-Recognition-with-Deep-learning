# Image-Recognition-with-Deep-learning
Uses ResNet101 to Recognise animal images and predict their label

This project demonstrates image classification using a pretrained ResNet101 model from PyTorch's torchvision library. The model has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, and the code utilizes transfer learning to classify images into one of the 1,000 categories of ImageNet.
